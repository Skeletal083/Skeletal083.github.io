    <h1>Skeletal</h1>
    <p><strong>Skeletal</strong> is a humanoid being, her species is unknown, but a defining feature is her pointed ears and naturally bright orange hair. She has pointed and sharp teeth and a scar along her left shoulder. She is close friends with <strong>Squirt</strong> and <strong>Nymph</strong>.She also had a brother named <strong>Ghostly</strong> who is no longer alive. She is a somewhat supernatural being and due to this her appearence can change to include:</p>

  <div id="Squirt">
    <h1>Squirt</h1>
    <p><strong>Squirt</strong> is <strong>Skeletal's</strong> best friend. She is a human female that got sacrificed to the ink and her story is derived from the <em>Bendy and The Ink Machine</em> games. She has ink for hair and cartoony eyes. She has deformed horns and a melting halo. Her arms are also often stained with ink spots from traversing the messy studio for so long. She met <strong>Skeletal</strong> when she was saved by her from the <em>Ink Demon's</em> attacks. Ever since, the two have been inseperable. She met <strong>Nymph</strong> a few years later, but they are also quite close.

  <div id="Nymph">
    <h1>Nymph</h1>
    <p><strong>Nymph</strong> doesn't really have a backstory to tell so I'm just going to describe her. <strong>Nymph</strong> is a fairy like being with blue and gold butterfly wings. She has short black hair with a natural gold streak in the front. She has gold flakes on her skin and a moon shaped birthmark. She has the abilitly to shoot gold strings out of each of her fingertips that are incredibly durable. She is friends with <strong>Squirt</strong> and <strong>Skeletal</strong>, but her and <strong>Skeletal</strong> tease eachother a lot.</p>

   </div>
  <div id="Ghostly">
    <h1>Ghostly</h1>
    <p><strong>Ghostly</strong> was <strong>Skeletal's</strong> little brother who passed away at the age of 8 for unknown reasons. He has shaggy blue hair and freckles. He was the same species as skeletal, but it is still unknown. He also had a tail and claws, though he didn't know how to control his abilities like <strong>Skeletal</strong>, so he didn't know how to retract them.</p>
